ruler
=====

Fork of small utility application for Windows called Ruler.

Original project was developed by Jeff Key:

- http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey/archive/2004/09/01/224433.aspx
- http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/ruler/
- http://ruler.codeplex.com/

I wanted to add some features and to have it hosted on GitHub.

New features:

- Lock ruler from resizing - it happens from time to time that when I move ruler around with mouse I accidentally resize it.
- Set size dialog - to set exact size I want ruler to be, not to try to adjust it with keyboard or mouse pixel by pixel.
- Duplicate ruler - often I need 2 rulers, with exactly same properties (TopMost, Show tool tip etc.) so there is now quick way to do it.

I have kept project to target .NET 2.0.
