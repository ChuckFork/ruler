Download working version:

Original project was developed by Jeff Key:

- ~~http://weblogs.asp.net/jkey/archive/2004/09/01/224433.aspx~~
- ~~http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/ruler/~~
- http://ruler.codeplex.com/

I wanted to add some features and to have it hosted on GitHub.

Support for .NET 2.0 is kept. :thumbsup:

<a name="newfeatures" href="#newfeatures">#</a>New features:

- **Duplicate ruler** - often I need 2 rulers, with exactly same properties (TopMost, Show tool tip etc.) so there is now quick way to do it.

- **Lock ruler from resizing** - it happens from time to time that when I move ruler around with mouse I accidentally resize it.

- **Set size dialog** - to set exact size I want ruler to be, not to try to adjust it with keyboard or mouse pixel by pixel.

### Ruler shortcuts:

- **Space** and **Double click** will toggle direction of ruler. 
- **Arrow keys** move ruler around
