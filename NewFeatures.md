- **Duplicate ruler** - often I need 2 rulers, with exactly same properties (TopMost, Show tool tip etc.) so there is now quick way to do it.

- **Lock ruler from resizing** - it happens from time to time that when I move ruler around with mouse I accidentally resize it.

- **Set size dialog** - to set exact size I want ruler to be, not to try to adjust it with keyboard or mouse pixel by pixel.
